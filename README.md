# CityCompeer

CityCompeer is a responsive website to assist new comers to a city.
Consider a college or boarding school student, an internal migrant or people moving abroad; a person that enters a new city is a complete stranger to the culture, market and the city environment.
CityCompeer will assist such users through features such as interactive ChatBot, Community Posts, availability of goods and rooms online for purchase or rent and many more friendly features.

## Features

- Light/dark mode toggle
- User friendly interface
- Personalised results
- Interactive assistance through ChatBot
